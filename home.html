      <h1><strong>Who is Elizabeth Warren?</strong></h1>
      Elizabeth Warren is a U.S. Senator for Massachusetts and running to be the 46th President of the United States. Born and raised in Oklohoma, she moved to Massachusetts to pursue a career in teaching. After the destruction caused by the 2008 financial crisis, she founded the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau where she helped millions of Americans recover from the predatory lending practices of banks at the time. In 2012 she defeated popular Republican incumbent Scott Brown to become a U.S. Senator.
